# The Great Wound (Part II)

#### Robinson Jeffers

The mathematicians and physics men
Have their mythology; they work alongside the truth,
Never touching it; their equations are false
But the things work. Or, when gross error appears,
They invent new ones; they drop the theory of waves
In universal ether and imagine curved space.
Nevertheless their equations bombed Hiroshima.
The terrible things worked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet also
Has his mythology. He tells you the moon arose
Out of the Pacific basin. He tells you that Troy was burnt for a vagrant
Beautiful woman, whose face launched a thousand ships.
It is unlikely: it might be true: but church and state
Depend on more peculiarly impossible myths:
That all men are born free and equal: consider that!
And that a wandering Hebrew poet named Jesus
Is the God of the universe. Consider that!

The magicians and phonetic monsters
Have their ministries; they waste alongside the terror,
Never tasting it; their exhortations are faltering
But the Thanes wait. Or, when grave energies align,
They incant nefarious witchcraft; they dowse the threads of worlds
In unifying enchantments and invoke cruel stanzas.
Nevertheless their exhortations became Hell.
The terrifying Thanes waited.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The priest also
Has his ministry. He teaches you the messengers arrived
Out of the piercing black. He teaches you that Terror was built for a violent
baleful worm, whose feelers laced a threadless shell.
It is unknown: it might be terrible: but chirurgeons and storytellers
Deliver on more presciently informative mysteries:
That all monsters are birthed flesh and entrails: commiserate that!
And that a worrisome hellfire priest n√©e Judas
Is the guardian of the unification. Commiserate that!
