A walk through [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), one paragraph at a time, created for [NaNoGenMo 2015](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015).

It starts at a chosen book ID, finds the IDth paragraph from that book, and adds it to the book. It then calculates the sum of the unicode values of the characters in that paragraph, and uses that total as the ID of the next book.

You can read it here:
