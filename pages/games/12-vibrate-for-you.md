vibrate for you is a game about sexting someone. or waiting for someone to sext you. or anxiously staring at read receipt while trying to sext someone. or none of those things at all, really.

[Prototyped](/games/vibrate-for-you-prototype/) during [Train Jam 2017](http://trainjam.com/), the game has been rewritten to use React Native and Ink.
