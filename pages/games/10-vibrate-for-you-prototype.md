vibrate for you is a game about sexting someone. or waiting for someone to sext you. or anxiously staring at read receipt while trying to sext someone. or none of those things at all, really.

Made during [Train Jam 2017](http://trainjam.com/), the prototype's narrative is parsed from Twine using a custom parser for Unity, built from scratch on a train (without internet access).
