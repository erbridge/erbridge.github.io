I'm a mathematical physicist turned programmer, currently making toys and games at [MakieLab](https://mymakie.com/){:target="_blank"} in London. I'm also working on a resource management sim called [*The Island*](/blog/) as well as some [open source projects](https://github.com/erbridge){:target="_blank"} such as [*Lime Text*](https://github.com/limetext){:target="_blank"}, a text editor for code.

I sometimes find time to play games, too.
