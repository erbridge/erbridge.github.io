My name is Felix Laurie von Massenbach. I'm a mathematical physicist turned programmer, currently freelancing, making games and web experiences. I'm an active contributor to the [open source community](https://github.com/erbridge){:target="_blank"} and am a maintainter for [*Lime Text*](https://github.com/limetext){:target="_blank"}, which will one day be a powerful text editor for code.

Thinking about hiring me? Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/erbridge), or [email me](mailto:felix@erbridge.co.uk). I'm comfortable anywhere in the stack.
