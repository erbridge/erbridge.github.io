My name is F (a.k.a. erbridge). I'm a mathematical physicist turned programmer, currently freelancing, making games and web experiences. I'm an active contributor to the [open source community](https://github.com/erbridge){:target="_blank"}, and am currently working on game about living with chronic illness (watch this space).

Thinking about hiring me? Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/erbridge){:target="_blank"}, or [email me](mailto:f@erbridge.co.uk){:target="_blank"}. I'm comfortable anywhere in the stack.
