I'm a mathematical physicist turned programmer, currently making toys and games at [MakieLab](https://mymakie.com/) in London. I'm also working on a resource management sim called [*The Island*](/blog/) as well as some [open source projects](https://github.com/erbridge) such as [*Lime Text*](https://github.com/limetext), a text editor for code.

Sometimes I find time to play games too.
